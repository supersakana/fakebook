## About

Gemz was created based on The Odin Project's criteria for building a [Facebook Clone](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-rails-final-project). My goal was to hit the project specs first, then experiment by adding new features. Writing simple integration and unit tests became an important part of my workflow. This would verify what was or was not working when developing.

Areas I get to improve would be organizing my code, testing, and styling the app properly. My attitude throughout this was to _just get it working_ and then identify blindspots after. If you the reader see areas I can improve, feel free to make an issue or email me at zacwilliamson@icloud.com. I'm always looking to improve my skills.
